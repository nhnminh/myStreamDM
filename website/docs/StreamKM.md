## StreamKM++ Clustering

*Ackermann, Lammersen, MÃ¤rtens, Raupach, Sohler, Swierkot. StreamKM++: A
Clustering Algorithm for Data Streams. In Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on
Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX 2010)*

###General Description

*StreamKM++* computes a small weighted sample of the data stream,called the
*coreset* of the data stream. A new data structure called coreset tree is
developed in order to significantly speed up the time necessary for sampling
non-uniformly during the coreset construction. After the coreset is extracted
from the data stream, a weighted k-means algorithm is applied on the coreset to
get the final clusters for the original stream data.

###Implementation

In StreamDM, three classes deal with the implementation of the StreamKM++
algorithm: `StreamKM`, `BucketManager`, and `TreeCoreset`.

`BucketManager` and `TreeCoreset` are the data structures to deal with the
coreset tree construction process. For the `TreeCoreset` class no parameters are
required; its behaviour is controlled by the `BucketMaanger`. The options for
`BucketManager` are:

* Stream data window size parameter (**-n**), which controls the stream data size 
(100000 by default), this value is inherited from the parameters of class `StreamKM`;
* Coreset size parameter (**-maxsize**) which controls the number of examples in 
the coreset for the stream data (10000 by default).

`StreamKM` implements the main algorithm, and is controlled by the following
parameters:

* Number of clusters parameter (**-k**), which controls how many clusters are
  output by the offline k-means algorithm (10 by default); 
* k-means iterations parameter (**-i**), which controls for how many iterations the
  k-means algorithm iterates (1000 by default);
* Coreset size parameter(**-s**), which controls the number of examples in the coreset
  for the StreamKM++ algorithm;
* Windows size parameter(**-w**), which controls how many examples in the stream data
  are used for coreset extraction for the StreamKM++ algorithm .
